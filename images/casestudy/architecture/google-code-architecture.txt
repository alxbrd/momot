A Java project based on this problem domain can be found in the repository. In this example, we assume that we have an existing set of classes and their dependencies, with the goal to group these classes into components. As objectives, we try to minimize the coupling between the components and maximize the cohesion within each component. We use the rules "createComponent" and "assignClass" for this example.
