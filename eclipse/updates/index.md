Since its initial release, MOMoT has been further developed in several stages. 
You can integrate MOMoT within Eclipse using one of the following update sites:

The **development** update site holds current stable development state of MOMoT and is updated as soon as a successful modification has been made.
The **stable** update site contains the latest released version of MOMoT.

| Release | Eclipse Update Site URL |
| --- | --- |
| Development | [`http://martin-fleck.github.io/momot/eclipse/updates/latest/develop/`](http://martin-fleck.github.io/momot/eclipse/updates/latest/develop/) |
| Stable | [`http://martin-fleck.github.io/momot/eclipse/updates/latest/stable/`](http://martin-fleck.github.io/momot/eclipse/updates/latest/stable/) |

In certain points in time during the development, a release gets pushed to the stable update site.
